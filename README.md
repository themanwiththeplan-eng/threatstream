## What this is used for?

I'd like this to be a one stop shop for people that are trying to find certain things related to threat intelligence. Essentially, this will be a threat feed that will be meant to run continuously either in a container or in some kind of cloud environment.

## If you'd like to contribute sources/code feel free
    - Send a pull request so that I can take a look at it
    - After reviewing I will either merge the pull request or I will deny it and add a comment as to why
    - Remember this is about as open source as it gets and because I'm just learning Go and trying to build something, don't be afraid to contribute :) 

---

## Disclaimer
    - If at some point this tool becomes big enough for organizations to use as a threat intel feed or maybe to research red team tactics, I just request that you contribute in some way, my goal is ultimately to build a community through the development of this and I know that I'm likely to have an extermely difficult time writing this all on my own

### I don't take things personally
    - I realize that there are things that are going to be in this codebase that are completely and entirely wrong, great! I'm not a developer and as I've said, I'm just learning. 
    - With that said, if you see that there is something wrong with my code, please, please, please Go ;) ahead and make changes, just explain why you made that change and why something is more efficient/better than what I've implemented in the first place

## Functionality to come
    - Persistent data streams for real time updates
    - Usage of sources, for now I just have some boilerplate stuff in there, don't worry my username is not username and my password is not password
    - More sources... Hopefully :) 
    - User-Agent randomization, I will probably implement this soon myself
